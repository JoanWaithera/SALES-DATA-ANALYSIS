# SALES-DATA-ANALYSIS
Sales Data Analysis for Business Insights

In this project, I was tasked with analyzing a company's sales data to provide actionable business insights. The goal was to populate the 'Overview' sheet with key analytics that would help the business make informed decisions. The project covers several areas, including sales trends, order analysis, and delivery performance, and aims to highlight insights that could drive strategic business actions.

Key Insights & Analysis:
Monthly Sales Trend: I analyzed the sales data over time to uncover patterns and trends in monthly sales, allowing the business to track performance and identify potential areas for growth or concern.
Online vs. Non-Online Orders: By evaluating the differences between online and non-online orders, I provided insights into customer purchasing behaviors and channel performance, helping the business focus on the most profitable channels.
Delivery Performance Analysis: I examined the lag between order date and ship date, providing a clear view of delivery efficiency. This insight is valuable for optimizing supply chain processes and improving customer satisfaction.
Top Salespeople: By calculating sales and volume, I identified the top-performing salespeople, providing the business with key performance metrics to reward and learn from the most successful team members.
Top Countries & Sales Reasons: I analyzed geographical sales data to pinpoint top-performing countries and assessed the most common sales reasons, helping the business focus on high-potential regions and key drivers for sales.
Additional Business Insights: Based on the data, I also suggested additional areas for analysis, offering the business opportunities to explore other aspects that might be relevant, such as customer behavior trends or sales seasonality.
Skills and Tools Used:
Excel: Extensive use of formulas, pivot tables, and data visualization to deliver clear and actionable insights.
Data Analysis: Applied statistical techniques and business acumen to extract valuable insights from the dataset.
Problem-Solving: Translated business questions into data-driven answers that support decision-making and strategic goals.
This project not only reflects my proficiency in data analysis but also demonstrates my ability to translate business questions into clear, actionable insights, helping companies optimize operations and drive growth.
